# Training-project: Wine quality prediction using support vector machine
Testing the quality of white wine as good or bad according to the given parameters using support vector machine supervised ML algorithm
White wine has 12 variables:
1.   fixed acidity
2.   volatile acidity
3.   citric acid
4.   residual sugars
5.   chlorides
6.   free sulfur dioxide
7.   total sulfur dioxide
8.   density
9.   pH
10.  sulphates
11.  alcohol
12.  quality
# Implemented SVM algorithm on white wine quality dataset which discriminates the two classes as good wine and bad wine quality respectively according to the physiochemical attributes of the white wine.
